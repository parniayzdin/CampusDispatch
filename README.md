# CampusDispatch
CampusDispatch Lite makes it easy to keep campus operations running smoothly. Users can report issues in real time, and dispatchers can quickly assign responders, track progress, and view every incident as it unfolds; all in one clear, organized dashboard.

## 💡This project is designed to streamline campus workflows by providing:
- Real-time issue reporting
- Dispatcher tools for assigning and updating tasks
- A live dashboard showing all open and resolved incidents
- Simple, intuitive UI for both users and responders

## 🖥️ Technical overview:
CampusDispatch is built as a lightweight workflow system for campus operations. The application follows a modular architecture that separates reporting, dispatching, and data processing, allowing each part to scale independently and remain easy to maintain.
